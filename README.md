# Project_Name:- Iris-Flower-Classification
## Project Summary:
In this project, I create a simple machine learning model to predict the species of flowers based on their features. In this project i used the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

# Introduction
This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning. Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -

1. Dicision tree classifier
2. K nearest classifier
3. SVM
4. Logistic Regression
5. metrics
6. train_test_split 

We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.
